🍎 Fruit Detection and Color Analysis using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project focuses on automatic fruit classification based on color analysis using Machine Learning (ML). The system extracts RGB color features from fruit images, processes the data, and applies a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to categorize different fruits. The goal is to build a robust and efficient fruit classification model that can be further enhanced for real-time fruit detection and advanced classification techniques.

🎯 Objectives
✅ Preprocess image data to standardize color representation.
✅ Extract RGB color features for accurate fruit classification.
✅ Apply KNN algorithm for classification and fine-tune hyperparameters.
✅ Analyze model performance using visualizations and statistical metrics.
✅ Explore real-world applications in agriculture, food industries, and automation.

📂 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Feature Extraction
RGB Values: Extracts average Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values from fruit images.
Image Preprocessing: Converts images to a consistent RGB color space for uniform feature extraction.
Structured Data Representation: Organizes extracted RGB values into a NumPy array for efficient model training.
2️⃣ Data Analysis
Color Histograms: Visualizes RGB distributions for each fruit type.
Scatter Plots: Shows relationships between RGB values to highlight classification boundaries.
Box Plots: Displays data variability, median values, and outliers.
Correlation Heatmaps: Analyzes RGB channel dependencies to refine feature selection.
3️⃣ Model Implementation - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
Why KNN?
✅ Simple yet effective for color-based classification.
✅ Works well with numerical RGB data.
✅ Easily adjustable via hyperparameter tuning.
Implementation Steps:
Initialize KNN with n_neighbors (e.g., 5).
Train the model using labeled fruit images.
Predict fruit categories for new images.
Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning & Optimization
GridSearchCV: Finds the optimal n_neighbors for KNN.
Cross-Validation: Prevents overfitting using K-Fold Cross-Validation.
5️⃣ Results & Evaluation
Performance Metrics:
